# UWP Samples
Samples for the Universal Windows Platform.

This repo contains few of my samples that usage the API for the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) in the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows 10.

## Pre-requirements
These samples require Visual Studio and the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows 10.

## Using the samples
The easiest way to use these samples without using Git is to download the zip file containing the current version (using the following link or by clicking the "Download ZIP" button on the repo page). You can then unzip the entire archive and use the samples in Visual Studio.
